## Implementation Notes

### Technical Requirements

- The solution must be lightweight enough to run on most devices
- It should work across browsers with WebGL support
- The 3D model loading should be optimized for faster loading
- The UI should be responsive and work on mobile devices

### 3D Model Requirements

- Models should be provided in GLB/GLTF format
- Models should use properly named materials/meshes to allow for customization
- Textures should be optimized for web use
- For complex products, LOD (Level of Detail) should be implemented

### Integration Requirements

- The package should be platform-agnostic
- It should provide clear documentation for integration
- The API should be simple and well-documented
- For WordPress/Shopify, specific guides should be provided

## Timeline
